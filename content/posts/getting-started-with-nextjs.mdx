# Getting Started with Next.js 15: The Complete Guide

Next.js has revolutionized the way we build React applications, and version 15 brings even more exciting features to the table. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore everything you need to know to get started with Next.js 15.

## What's New in Next.js 15?

Next.js 15 introduces several groundbreaking features that make development faster and more efficient:

### 1. Improved App Router

The App Router has been significantly enhanced with better performance and developer experience:

```typescript
// app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Server Components

Server Components now offer better streaming and loading capabilities:

```typescript
// app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx
export default async function PostPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug)

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </article>
  )
}
```

## Setting Up Your First Next.js 15 Project

Getting started is easier than ever:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Best Practices for Next.js Development

Here are some essential best practices to follow:

1. **Use TypeScript** for better type safety
2. **Implement proper SEO** with metadata API
3. **Optimize images** with next/image
4. **Leverage caching** for better performance

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Image Optimization

```typescript
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Hero() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/hero.jpg"
      alt="Hero image"
      width={800}
      height={600}
      priority
    />
  )
}
```

### Code Splitting

Next.js automatically handles code splitting, but you can optimize further:

```typescript
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/Heavy'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
})
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 represents a significant step forward in React development. With its improved performance, better developer experience, and powerful new features, it's the perfect time to start your next project with Next.js.

Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex web application, Next.js provides all the tools you need to create fast, scalable, and maintainable applications.

Happy coding!
